Logging In
==========

Each LAVA instance offers a :ref:`local_user` and may also be configured to an
alternative authentication method:

* :ref:`ldap_authentication`

.. seealso:: :ref:`user_authentication` for more information.

LDAP authentication relies on local configuration and may involve obtaining a
privileged access token from the LDAP administrators.

Local accounts remain available for all instances.

Whichever authentication method is used, there is no difference in how users
interact with LAVA once logged in.

.. _local_user:

Local User Account
------------------

A local user account may be created by an administrator within LAVA. The
administrator may grant different permissions to the user to perform various
operations within LAVA. A typical login screen will look something like the
following.

.. image:: ./images/local-user-login.png

To log in with a username and password, enter your credentials in the provided
text boxes and click "Login" button.

Local user accounts can be particularly useful for automated users like build
systems or continuous integration scripts using the XML-RPC API. In this case, a local
admin can create the user with a secure password, log in as that user to create
an authentication token and then supply the token to the scripts.

Linaro lab users
----------------

Linaro's central validation lab in Cambridge is accessible via
https://validation.linaro.org/ . It is Linaro's core production instance of
LAVA.

This lab is configured to use Linaro LDAP. To log in, enter your details in the
LDAP login fields.

.. note:: If your Linaro email is ``first.second@linaro.org`` then use
   ``first.second`` as your username.

.. image:: ./images/ldap-user-login.png

A successful authentication will redirect you to https://validation.linaro.org/

If you do not have a Linaro LDAP account, you can register at
https://register.linaro.org/.

After logging in, the LAVA scheduler page will look something like the
following:
