VLANd support in LAVA test jobs
###############################

What is a VLAN?
***************

VLANs are a networking technology that can be used to provide control and
isolation of network ports. Setting up VLANs can create multiple separate
private networks between specified switch ports. This is equivalent to setting
up multiple different physical networks with separate switches, but with the
benefit that it is configured in software instead of needing physical
connection changes. This means that networks can be reconfigured on the fly,
even remotely.

.. _vlan_support:

VLANd and LAVA
**************

:term:`VLANd` is a simple utility to control switches on a single-site,
single-network basis. LAVA V2 supports the use of VLANd as one of its
:ref:`protocols`, allowing for integration of control of VLANs as part of the
setup of a MultiNode test job.

Unlike the :ref:`multinode_protocol`, the ``lava-vland`` protocol has only a
minimal API for use during the test shell, providing static information about
the network interfaces on the device. The :ref:`multinode_api` is also
available, as with all other multinode jobs.

.. important:: MultiNode can be hard to understand and debug in a test job;
   adding VLANd control adds yet more flexibility and therefore more complexity
   to the test configuration. Although helpers are provided to access specific
   pieces of information, the difficulty of turning the helpers into a usable
   test definition should not be underestimated. :ref:`Custom scripts
   <custom_scripts>` are **strongly** recommended. The helpers simply echo out
   variables set by LAVA, so placeholders can be used when testing custom
   scripts, allowing test writers to debug scripts on local machines outside of
   LAVA.

VLANd test shell helpers
========================

VLANd configuration is used to control networking of the devices in a test.
Accordingly, the VLANd test shell helpers give a test writer more information
about the networking setup of those devices during a test.

The information about each of the interfaces on a test device will include the
following data elements:

* **interface label** - this is an arbitrary unique label assigned by the admin
  in device configuration, used purely as a key to enable lookup of other data
  elements. It is **not** the interface name that would be used/configured
  using system tools such as ``ifconfig`` or ``ip`` (e.g. ``eth0``, ``ens3``),
  as those interface names are assigned at boot in potentially random order and
  may change from test to test on the same device.

* **MAC address** - the MAC address set by the admin in the device
  configuration for the specified interface label.

* **sysfs path** - the path in ``/sys`` to the device as declared by the admin
  in the device configuration for the specified interface label. The path
  itself will typically **not** include an interface name (``eth0`` etc.) as
  this can be changed with a different userspace.

* **interface tags** - the :term:`tags <interface tag>` specified by the test
  writer. The tag needs to match the available tags specified by the admin in
  the device configuration. Interface tags determine which devices of the
  requested :term:`device type` are scheduled for the test job.

  .. seealso:: :ref:`vland_device_tags`

* **vlan_name** - the name specified by the test writer for the VLAN using the
  requested tags. Each VLAN will relate to one or more interface labels.

The test writer is responsible for :ref:`finding out the current interface name
<vland_identify_interface_names>` assigned by the kernel for the relevant
interface label by using the ``sysfs`` path and the MAC address. Interface
names can be modified by userspace so **must** be identified after boot.

lava-vland-self
---------------

Prints details of the admin-assigned interface **label**, mac address and
``sysfs`` path for each interface on this device, comma separated without
whitespace:

.. code-block:: shell

 iface1,00:e0:4c:53:44:58,/sys/devices/platform/ocp/47400000.usb/47401c00.usb/musb-hdrc.1.auto/usb1/1-1/1-1:1.0/net/
 iface0,90:59:af:5e:69:fd,/sys/devices/platform/ocp/4a100000.ethernet/net/

If the interface label is ``iface0``, this will output the MAC address:

.. code-block:: shell

 - lava-vland-self | grep iface0 | cut -d',' -f2

The ``sysfs`` path is allowed to contain commas and other characters, so to get
the path use ``-`` to get all fields after the third match:

.. code-block:: shell

 - lava-vland-self | grep iface0 | cut -d',' -f3-

.. seealso:: :ref:`custom_scripts`

lava-vland-tags
---------------

Prints the interface tag details of the :ref:`vland_interfaces` for this
device, comma separated without whitespace:

.. code-block:: shell

 iface1,100M
 iface0,1G
 iface0,100M

lava-vland-names
----------------

Lists all the vlan names for this device and the interface labels associated
with each vlan. Each entry is comma separated on one line, with no whitespace.

.. code-block:: shell

 vlan_one,iface0
 vland_two,iface1

.. _vland_identify_interface_names:

Identifying interface names
===========================

The MAC address is usually the best way to identify specific interfaces, but in
some cases this may not work (e.g. badly designed test devices without
persistent MAC addresses) so it's possible to use the ``sysfs`` path as a
fallback here. The runtime interface name of a particular interface may change
from boot to boot, so it is necessary to look this up during your test.

It's possible to use other tools like ``ifconfig`` and ``ip`` to look up an
interface name, but the easiest way to use a MAC address to look up an
interface name is typically by looking directly in ``sysfs``:

.. code-block:: shell

 #!/bin/sh

 # MAC and SYSFS would have been determined already
 # using lava-vland-self
 MAC="a0:36:9f:39:0b:d7"
 SYSFS="/sys/devices/pci0000:00/0000:00:03.0/0000:07:00.1/net/"

 # match the MAC to the address in sysfs
 # identify the interface name from the matching sysfs path.
 NAME=`grep -l ${MAC} ${SYSFS}*/address | awk -F/ '{print $(NF-1)}'`
 echo ${NAME}

Possible output would be::

 eth4

Combined with ``lava-vland-self``, this provides a way for the test writer to
know that ``vlan_one`` on this device uses ``eth0``. This information can then
be used to derive the IP address.

.. note:: This kind of operation is best done with a :ref:`custom script
   <custom_scripts>` using a language better suited to these kinds of
   operations (like perl or python). These examples try to use the lowest
   common denominator - busybox. As a result, the examples can appear to be
   more complex than strictly necessary.

The :ref:`multinode_api` can then be used to broadcast the information about
this device using ``lava-send`` and retrieve information from other devices in
the group using ``lava-wait``.

.. _vland_restrictions:

VLANd Restrictions
==================

The design of VLANd set out some clear constraints on the support to be created:

* 1 **access** port on 1 switch being on 1 VLAN, no more, no less.

  * aka a port-based or static or manually-created VLAN (depending on which
    vendorâ€™s docs you read!).

* No support for dynamic VLANs

  * (switch calling out to external services to determine which VLAN a
    newly-detected connection should be connected to)

* No support for filtering on ports to set up VLANs by traffic analysis etc.
* No support for egress/ingress control such that a port may interact with
  ports outside of its own defined VLAN.
* No support for cross-site VLANs via QinQ or similar.
* Ports defined in terms of the switch/port combination.
* Some switch/port combinations are to be **locked** so that test jobs cannot
  put infrastructure devices into a test VLAN.

.. _vland_design:

VLANd Design goals and considerations
=====================================

* Set up arbitrary sets of VLANs
* Map interfaces to switch ports in the LAVA device instance configuration.
* Run a single VLAN daemon instance per lab
* Switches are identified by IP or hostname - DNS must work for names to be used
* Support a regular background read-only check that the switch config is
  reflected in the DB

.. _lava_vland_devices:

LAVA and VLANd Device considerations
====================================

.. _vland_multiple_interfaces:

Requirement for multiple interfaces
-----------------------------------

Initial support for VLANd in LAVA sets up the VLANs at the start of the job.
Many test jobs will require the device to download artifacts from the
dispatcher (which itself has downloaded from third party sites) using protocols
like TFTP. The device therefore needs to be able to reach the dispatcher over
the network and this has implications for which devices are usable with VLANd
at this stage.

Devices to be used with VLANd **must** have multiple network interfaces. It is
**not** required that all interfaces are enabled at boot, simply that the boot
process has a usable network interface. It is up to the test job writer whether
the other interface(s) are enabled at boot or enabled/disabled during the test
job - VLANd has no requirement other than that the physical hardware has a
cable attached to the specified switch/port.

Future changes are expected to allow for devices with only a single interface
to use VLANd but this requires code changes to support setting up the VLAN
after the device has downloaded files using TFTP but before the serial
connection is used to run the boot commands. This could result in a test job
where the device has no access to the internet or the dispatcher during the
rest of the test job. LAVA continues to control the physical device using the
serial connection, including to implement the :ref:`multinode_api` but some
test jobs may use dynamic connections made from the dispatcher - such test jobs
would not be able to use VLANd on devices with only a single network interface.

.. _vland_locking:

LAVA and locked switch/port combinations
----------------------------------------

VLANd supports locking particular switch/port combinations to prevent test jobs
interfering with critical lab infrastructure (like a PDU or the dispatcher
itself). The dispatcher is serving many jobs simultaneously, so cannot be part
of any VLAN created by a test job.

The ``lava-vland`` protocol will **not** be allowed to modify locked
switch/port combinations or to lock switch/port combinations used within the
test job. LAVA will control the raising and tear down of VLANs using the
``lava-vland`` protocol, so that each test job gets access only to the VLANs
that the test job itself defines.

.. _vland_multinode:

VLANd and MultiNode
===================

* VLANd is restricted to a single mapping of a switch and port to a single
  interface on a device

* A VLAN which only ever contains a single device is not typically a useful
  test of the networking support on that device.

* The MultiNode :term:`role` determines which devices go onto which named VLAN.

So the ``lava-vland`` protocol is directly tied to the ``lava-multinode``
protocol, with one additional restriction:

* Any :term:`role` used by ``lava-vland`` **must only** set a count of **one**.
  There is no limit to the number of roles as long as each is unique across the
  MultiNode job.

.. _lava_vlan_database:

LAVA VLANd database support
***************************

Details of which interface of which board is on which port of which switch is
collectively called the :ref:`network map <vland_network_map>` which is
maintained by the lab admins. See :ref:`admin_vland_lava`.

Test writers get to see which :term:`types of device <device type>` support
which interfaces and which :term:`interface tag`, together with :term:`device
tags <device tag>`. This allows test writers to specify which devices are used
for a particular test, without being tied to a set of device hostnames that may
change from time to time. LAVA then maps the test writer request to a specific
device, interface and switch/port combination and constructs the commands to
pass to :term:`VLANd`.

Test writers do not provide explicit switch/port instructions; the test job
simply defines the type of device to use, the interfaces to use and any device
tags required. LAVA then assembles this into a series of instructions to VLANd.
This allows test jobs to be re-used without regard to whether the lab admins
have had to change the physical topology of the network, as long as the same
services remain available.

.. _vland_interfaces:

Interfaces and link speeds
==========================

Test writers provide information about the device interfaces using the
**lava-vland** protocol syntax which matches a :term:`role` with a name for a
VLAN and a list of tags (which may be loosely related to link speeds) which
that role needs to be able to provide. **All** of the specified tags must be
supported by the interface before the device will be accepted as suitable for
the test job.

Devices may also have requirements that booting can only use certain interfaces
(which may be considered as *primary*), e.g. bootloaders may lack the ability
to detect and/or use a network interface which uses a USB network converter
when a physical ethernet port is also fitted. If the primary ethernet port is
put onto a VLAN, the bootloader may be unable to raise a network interface. See
:ref:`identify_primary_interfaces` and check with your local admins about how
such issues may be identified and avoided, e.g. by not specifying tags for
*primary* interfaces.

.. index:: vlan interface tag

.. _vland_device_tags:

VLANd and interface tags in LAVA
--------------------------------

LAVA can use interface tags to distinguish between devices of the same
:term:`device type`. Commonly, the values in the tags might relate to useful
features of an interface: the link speeds it supports, the interface types it
supports (RJ43, SFP) or other things like its manufacturer. The tags that can
be used are entirely arbitrary: LAVA itself attaches no particular meaning to
the tags. When selecting devices for a test job, a device is assigned if the
device dictionary tags match or exceed the requested tags in the job
definition.

Therefore, if tags are to be expressed as link speeds, all link speeds
must be included in the device dictionary, using whatever notation is agreed
between the admins and the test writers. A 10G link which is also capable of
1G needs to be expressed as ``['1G', '10G']`` (ordering is irrelevant). A device
with such an interface can then be assigned a testjob requiring a
10G link or a testjob requiring a 1G link.

The syntax of the interface tag is arbitrary - individual labs can choose to
extend the tag to embed more information than the link speed or use a different
pattern of their own choice.

This is in line with how a :term:`device tag` is used elsewhere in LAVA,
it is the use of such a tag in the device dictionary which is custom to
VLANd.

The list of vland-type tags available for a device will be declared on
the server page for that device but in a different section from other tags.

.. _vland_vlan_name:

Assigning roles to a VLAN
=========================

The name for the VLAN, as specified by the test writer, is an arbitrary label -
the actual name used by VLANd will be calculated by LAVA based on the test job
ID and the MultiNode target group ID. In a similar way to a role, the name is
used to associate different roles onto the same VLAN.

.. _example_vland_protocol:

Example vland protocol YAML
===========================

All uses of the **lava-vland** protocol also require the
:ref:`multinode_protocol`, this example just looks at the vland component.

.. code-block:: yaml

  lava-vland:
    client:
      vlan_one:
        - 10G
    server:
      vlan_one:
        - 1G

Any one role can be put onto multiple vlans. Managing the routing and
specifying which interface is up or down at any particular point of a test job
is entirely within the remit of the test writer:

.. code-block:: yaml

  lava-vland:
    master:
      vlan_one:
        - 10G
      vlan_two:
        - 1G
    slave:
      vlan_one:
        - 1G
    soldier:
      vlan_two:
        - 1G

.. _example_test_yaml:

Example YAML for the protocols
==============================

Combining the ``lava-vland`` protocol with the ``lava-multinode`` protocol
shows how the roles match up.

.. note:: :ref:`vland_multinode` support dictates that the ``count`` for roles
   which are used by ``lava-vland`` can only ever be **1**.

This example will create a single VLAN which the test writer will be able to
see as **vlan_one** and this VLAN will contain a single beaglebone-black and a
single cubietruck. The beaglebone-black is required to provide at least one
interface capable of a 10G link speed (so this example is unlikely to ever find
a suitable device) and the cubietruck is required to provide an interface
capable of 1G. (The actual meaning of the interface tags is up to the lab
admins but it is expected that most admins will use the established convention
of G === gigabit per second.) In addition, this example stipulates that the
beaglebone-black is to support a :term:`device tag` called ``usb-eth`` and the
cubietruck is to support a device tag called ``sata``. Depending on the setup
of the lab, these tags can be used to indicate that the beaglebone-black has a
USB ethernet converter as well as the on-board physical ethernet support and
that the cubietruck has an accessible SATA drive.

.. code-block:: yaml

 protocols:
   lava-multinode:
     roles:
       client:
         device_type: bbb
         count: 1

         - usb-eth
       server:
          device_type: cubietruck
         count: 1
         tags:
         - sata
     timeout:
       seconds: 60
   lava-vland:
     client:
       vlan_one:
         - 10G
     server:
       vlan_one:
         - 1G
