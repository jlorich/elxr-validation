The checksum of the file to download can be provided, and if so it will be
checked against the downloaded content. This can help to detect multiple
potential problems such as misconfigured caching or corrupted downloads. If
compression is used, the checksum to specify is the checksum of the compressed
file, irrespective of whether that file is decompressed later.
