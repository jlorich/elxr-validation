.. index:: secondary media sata

to: sata
********

Deploy unchanged images to secondary SATA media. Any bootloader inside the
image will **not** be used. Instead, the files needed for the boot are
specified in the deployment. The entire physical device is available to the
secondary deployment. Secondary relates to the expected requirement of a
primary boot (e.g. ramdisk or NFS) which provides a suitable working
environment to deploy the image directly to the secondary device. See
:ref:`secondary_media`.

Not all devices support SATA media.

The test writer needs to provide the following information about the image:

.. index:: secondary media sata kernel

.. _deploy_to_sata_kernel:

kernel *
========

* **kernel**: The path, within the image, to the kernel which will be used by
  the bootloader.

.. index:: secondary media sata ramdisk

.. _deploy_to_sata_ramdisk:

ramdisk
=======

* **ramdisk**: (optional). If used, must be a path, within the image, which the
  bootloader can use.

.. index:: secondary media sata dtb

.. _deploy_to_sata_dtb:

dtb *
=====

* **dtb**: The path, within the image, to the dtb which will be used by the
  bootloader.

.. index:: secondary media sata uuid

.. _deploy_to_sata_uuid:

UUID *
======

* **UUID**: The UUID of the partition which contains the root filesystem of the
  booted image.

.. index:: secondary media sata boot_part

.. _deploy_to_sata_boot_part:

boot_part *
===========

* **boot_part**: the partition on the media from which the bootloader can read
  the kernel, ramdisk & dtb.

.. note:: If the image mounts the boot partition at a mounpoint below the root
   directory of the image, the path to files within that partition must **not**
   include that mountpoint. The bootloader will read the files directly from
   the partition.
